# Descriptive-Statistics-with-R

# Statistics
Statistics is a collection of mathematics to deal with data organization, analysis, and interpretation. 
Three main statistical methods are used in the data analysis: descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and regressions analysis.

# Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics summarize the data and usually focuses on the distribution (normal distribution or binomial distribution), 
the central tendency (it describes the data with respect to the center of the data, and it can be the mean, median, and mode of the data), 
and the dispersion of data (it describes the spread of the data, and it can be the variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range).

# Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics tests the relationship between two data sets or two samples, and a hypothesis is usually set for the statistical relationships between them. The hypothesis can be a null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis, and rejecting the null hypothesis is done using tests like the T Test (for continuous variables), Chi Square Test (for categorical variables), and ANOVA (for complex applications).
Regressions analysis is used to identify the relationships between two variables. Regressions can be linear regressions (simple linear regression, multiple linear regression), or non-linear regressions.
What is the R?

# R programming language
R is an open-source software within the GNU package, for statistical computing and graphics, it compiles and runs on a wide variety of Linux platforms, Windows, and Mac OS. The simplest way to install the program is to follow the online instructions and use the default options. Because R is open-source software, it contains hundreds of packages developed by researchers around the world for various statistical analyses and data mining.
The R is a high-level programming language that is designed to be used by a human and is closer to the human language, it needs to be converted to machine language before being executed, so a high-level programming language can be slower. On the other hand, a lower-level programming language is a lot closer to the machine and computer language, it can be executed directly on a computer without the need to convert between languages before execution, so it can be faster than a high-level programming language and more inclined towards machine languages that deal with bits 0 and 1.
You can download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) via (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). Once there, under Download and Install R, choose and run the appropriate precompiled binary distributions (Download R Linux, Download R for Mac OS, or Download R for Windows). 

# What is the RStudio (IDE)?
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It adds modern features like syntax highlighting and code refactoring to R. In other words, it brings all the features that you need together in one place. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using web browser.
You can download and Install RStudio IDE via (www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You can download and Install Git, a popular version control system on Windows via (https://git-scm.com/download/win).

# The R Built-in Datasets
The purpose of statistical analysis is to extract and assess the information contained in data that has arisen in many diverse situations. 
However, the R has a datasets package containing a variety of datasets built-in. To see a summary of the datasets contained in the package, 
use the library(help=”datasets”) function. Examples of R built-in datasets:
